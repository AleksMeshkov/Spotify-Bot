## Introduction
This is a Telegram bot that has the ability to make calls to the Spotify API to satisfy user requests. This bot is wrtten in Python and is being developed with the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) provided by the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) team. The documentation for the API that I used is located [here](https://python-telegram-bot.org/)
