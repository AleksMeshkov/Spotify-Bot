## Introduction
This is a Telegram bot that has the ability to make calls to the Spotify API to satisfy user requests. This bot is wrtten in Python and is being developed with the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) provided by the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) team. The documentation for the API that I used is located [here](https://python-telegram-bot.org/)

## Usage
To use the bot, you will first need to create a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account. Once you do that, you can call the bot from anywhere by calling the bot with @spotify_telegram_bot.

To make a search, call the bot and type. The bot will respond with an option to grab the top result of either a track, artist, album or playlist and you can click which you would like to get a Spotify link to the item.

*P.S - Because of the change to an inline bot, general search is currently unavailable. I hoping to re-implement this in the near future. Sorry for the inconvenience.*
